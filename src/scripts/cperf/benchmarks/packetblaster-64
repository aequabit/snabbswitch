# There is a reason for this Shell script being so weird
# (by using `set -e' and `echo $out | ...'):
#
# If a benchmark script fails it MUST exit with a non-zero status. Thus
# we make sure that the status returned reflects the benchmarks results
# and NOT the commands that extract the desired portion of the benchmarks
# output. (Last time I checked, even with `set -e ', a plain pipe will
# exit with status 0 even if one of the commands does not).

set -e

[ ! -z "$PCIADDR" ] || export PCIADDR=pciaddr # Change me.

# The actual benchmark.
out=$(cd src; sudo ./snabb packetblaster replay --duration 1 \
    program/packetblaster/64.pcap \
    "$PCIADDR")

# Extract floating point Mpps number from output.
pps=$(echo "$out" | grep TXDGPC | cut -f 3 | sed s/,//g)
